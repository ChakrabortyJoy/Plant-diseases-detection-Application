# Plant Disease Detection

Tech meets agriculture in our Plant Disease Detection Project! 🌱🔍 Open-source machine learning and image analysis combine to safeguard crops, ensuring sustainable yields. Join us to nurture greener tomorrows. 🌿🌾

## Overview

The project helps farmers reduce crop failure by detecting diseases at early stages. We've trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a dataset with 70k+ images of 38 categories of plant diseases.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.9+ recommended).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   gh repo clone ChakrabortyJoy/Plant-diseases-detection-Application
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Download the trained model (a `.h5` file) from github and place it in the project directory.


## Running the App

To run the Plant Disease Prediction app, execute the following command in your terminal:
```
streamlit run main.py
```
This will start the Streamlit development server, and you can access the app in your web browser by navigating to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

Make sure you are in the project directory when you run the above command.

## Required Packages

Make sure you have the following packages installed:
